# Egypt Car Plates Detection
# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting Egyptian car license plates using the YOLOv7 model. It is designed to demonstrate the application of object detection techniques to real-world scenarios, specifically in the automatic recognition of vehicle license plates in Egypt.

# Features
License Plate Detection: Utilizes the YOLOv7 model to accurately detect car plates in various settings and conditions.
Data Processing: Includes scripts for processing images to prepare them for the detection model.
Model Training: Provides details on how the YOLOv7 model is trained with a dataset of Egyptian car plates.
Testing and Evaluation: Contains testing scripts to evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.
# Technology Stack
YOLOv7: A state-of-the-art model for real-time object detection.
Python: For scripting and model development.
OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and testing.
